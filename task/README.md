# Session 10 Task:-

Build a `meetup` application that user can: 
1. View a list of meetups objects. 
2. Add meetup and preview it while typing and `log` it into the console on submit.

## The shape of the data coming from the server:
```javascript
[
  {
    name: "Meetup 1",
    location: "Cairo",
    Topic: "React"
  },
  {
    name: "Meetup 2",
    location: "New York",
    Topic: "Angular"
  },
  ...etc
]
```

Use what you've learned to render this list of objects and add to it by updating the `state`
